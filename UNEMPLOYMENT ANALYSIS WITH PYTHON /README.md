Iris flower has three species; setosa, versicolor, and virginica, which differs according to their measurements. We have considered the measurements of the iris flowers according to their species, and we have trained a machine learning model that can learn from the measurements of the iris species and classify them.

The dataset for this project originates from the Machine Learning Repository.

The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor). Four features were measured from each sample (in centimetres):
